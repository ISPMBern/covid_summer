## Impact of cross-border-associated cases on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Switzerland during summer 2020 and 2021
#### Background
During the summers of 2020 and 2021, the number of confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Switzerland remained at relatively low levels, but grew steadily over time. It remains unclear to what extent epidemic growth during these periods was a result of the relaxation of local control measures or increased traveling and subsequent importation of cases. A better understanding of the role of cross-border-associated cases (imports) on the local epidemic dynamics will help to inform future surveillance strategies.

#### Aim To quantify the impact of imports on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trends in Switzerland during summer periods.

#### Methods
We analyzed routine surveillance data of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland from 1 June to 30 September 2020 and 2021. We used a stochastic branching process model that accounts for superspreading of SARS-CoV-2 to simulate epidemic trajectories in absence and in presence of imports during summer 2020 and 2021.
We used approximate Bayesian computation to infer the value of the effective reproduction number $R_e$ in the absence and presence of imports.

#### Results
The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health reported 22,919 and 145,840 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 from 1 June to 30 September 2020 and 2021, respectively. Among cases with known place of exposure, 27% (3,276 of 12,088) and 25% (1,110 of 4,368) reported an exposure abroad in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Without considering the impact of imported cases, the steady growth of confirmed cases during summer periods would be consistent with a value of $R_e$ that is significantly above the critical threshold of 1. In contrast, we estimated $R_e$ at 0.84 (95% credible interval, CrI: 0.78--0.90) in 2020 and 0.82 (95% CrI: 0.74--0.90) in 2021 when imported cases were taken into account, indicating that the local $R_e$ was below the critical threshold of 1 during summer.

#### Conclusions
In Switzerland, cross-border-associated SARS-CoV-2 cases had a considerable impact on the local transmission dynamics and can explain the steady growth of the epidemic during the summers of 2020 and 2021.
