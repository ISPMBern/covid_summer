	abstract = {Background
              Estimating key infectious disease parameters from the coronavirus disease ({COVID}-19) outbreak is essential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies.
            
            
              Aim
              We estimate the generation interval, serial interval, proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission and effective reproduction number of {COVID}-19. We illustrate that reproduction numbers calculated based on serial interval estimates can be biased.
            
            
              Methods
              We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates, we obtained the serial interval, proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers.
            
            
              Results
              The mean generation interval was 5.20 days (95\% credible interval ({CrI}): 3.78–6.78) for Singapore and 3.95 days (95\% {CrI}: 3.01–4.91) for Tianjin. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48\% (95\% {CrI}: 32–67) for Singapore and 62\% (95\% {CrI}: 50–76) for Tianjin. Reproduction number estimates based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information.
            
            
              Conclusion
              High estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order to control the {COVID}-19 outbreak. Notably, quarantine and other containment measures were already in place at the time of data collection, which may inflate the proportion of infections from pre-symptomatic individuals.},

	url = {http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.10.25.20219063},
	abstract = {Following its emergence in late 2019, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 has caused a global pandemic resulting in unprecedented efforts to reduce transmission and develop therapies and vaccines ({WHO} Emergency Committee, 2020; Zhu
            et al
            ., 2020). Rapidly generated viral genome sequences have allowed the spread of the virus to be tracked via phylogenetic analysis (Hadfield
            et al
            ., 2018; Pybus
            et al
            ., 2020; Worobey
            et al
            ., 2020). While the virus spread globally in early 2020 before borders closed, intercontinental travel has since been greatly reduced, allowing continent-specific variants to emerge. However, within Europe travel resumed in the summer of 2020, and the impact of this travel on the epidemic is not well understood. Here we report on a novel {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variant, 20A.{EU}1, that emerged in Spain in early summer, and subsequently spread to multiple locations in Europe, accounting for the majority of sequences by autumn. We find no evidence of increased transmissibility of this variant, but instead demonstrate how rising incidence in Spain, resumption of travel across Europe, and lack of effective screening and containment may explain the variant’s success. Despite travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, we estimate 20A.{EU}1 was introduced hundreds of times to countries across Europe by summertime travellers, likely undermining local efforts to keep {SARS}-{CoV}-2 cases low. Our results demonstrate how genomic surveillance is critical to understanding how travel can impact {SARS}-{CoV}-2 transmission, and thus for informing future containment strategies as travel resumes.

                  20A.{EU}1 most probably rose in frequency in multiple countries due to travel and difference in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 prevalence. There is no evidence that it spreads faster
                  .
                
              
              
                
                  There are currently no data to evaluate whether this variant affects the severity of the disease
                  .
                
              
              
                
                  While dominant in some countries, 20A.{EU}1 has not taken over everywhere and diverse variants of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 continue to circulate across Europe. 20A.{EU}1 is not the cause of the European ‘second wave.’},
