	abstract = {Background
              Estimating key infectious disease parameters from the coronavirus disease ({COVID}-19) outbreak is essential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies.
            
            
              Aim
              We estimate the generation interval, serial interval, proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission and effective reproduction number of {COVID}-19. We illustrate that reproduction numbers calculated based on serial interval estimates can be biased.
            
            
              Methods
              We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates, we obtained the serial interval, proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers.
            
            
              Results
              The mean generation interval was 5.20 days (95\% credible interval ({CrI}): 3.78–6.78) for Singapore and 3.95 days (95\% {CrI}: 3.01–4.91) for Tianjin. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48\% (95\% {CrI}: 32–67) for Singapore and 62\% (95\% {CrI}: 50–76) for Tianjin. Reproduction number estimates based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information.
            
            
              Conclusion
              High estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order to control the {COVID}-19 outbreak. Notably, quarantine and other containment measures were already in place at the time of data collection, which may inflate the proportion of infections from pre-symptomatic individuals.},

	abstract = {Following its emergence in late 2019, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 has caused a global pandemic resulting in unprecedented efforts to reduce transmission and develop therapies and vaccines ({WHO} Emergency Committee, 2020; Zhu
            et al
            ., 2020). Rapidly generated viral genome sequences have allowed the spread of the virus to be tracked via phylogenetic analysis (Hadfield
            et al
            ., 2018; Pybus
            et al
            ., 2020; Worobey
            et al
            ., 2020). While the virus spread globally in early 2020 before borders closed, intercontinental travel has since been greatly reduced, allowing continent-specific variants to emerge. However, within Europe travel resumed in the summer of 2020, and the impact of this travel on the epidemic is not well understood. Here we report on a novel {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variant, 20A.{EU}1, that emerged in Spain in early summer, and subsequently spread to multiple locations in Europe, accounting for the majority of sequences by autumn. We find no evidence of increased transmissibility of this variant, but instead demonstrate how rising incidence in Spain, resumption of travel across Europe, and lack of effective screening and containment may explain the variant’s success. Despite travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, we estimate 20A.{EU}1 was introduced hundreds of times to countries across Europe by summertime travellers, likely undermining local efforts to keep {SARS}-{CoV}-2 cases low. Our results demonstrate how genomic surveillance is critical to understanding how travel can impact {SARS}-{CoV}-2 transmission, and thus for informing future containment strategies as travel resumes.

Such inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection. Here, we show that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the generation interval distribution equal to the observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number.},

            Accurate estimates of the burden of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection are critical to informing pandemic response. Confirmed {COVID}-19 case counts in the U.S. do not capture the total burden of the pandemic because testing has been primarily restricted to individuals with moderate to severe symptoms due to limited test availability. Here, we use a semi-Bayesian probabilistic bias analysis to account for incomplete testing and imperfect diagnostic accuracy. We estimate 6,454,951 cumulative infections compared to 721,245 confirmed cases (1.9\% vs. 0.2\% of the population) in the United States as of April 18, 2020. Accounting for uncertainty, the number of infections during this period was 3 to 20 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. 86\% (simulation interval: 64–99\%) of this difference is due to incomplete testing, while 14\% (0.3–36\%) is due to imperfect test accuracy. The approach can readily be applied in future studies in other locations or at finer spatial scale to correct for biased testing and imperfect diagnostic accuracy to provide a more realistic assessment of {COVID}-19 burden.},

              The {COVID}-19 pandemic has shown how a newly emergent communicable disease can lay considerable burden on public health. To avoid system collapse, governments have resorted to several social distancing measures. In Belgium, this included a lockdown and a following period of phased re-opening. A representative sample of Belgian adults was asked about their contact behaviour from mid-April to the beginning of August, during different stages of the intervention measures in Belgium. Use of personal protection equipment (face masks) and compliance to hygienic measures was also reported. We estimated the expected reproduction number computing the ratio of

              with respect to pre-pandemic data. During the first two waves (the first month) of the survey, the reduction in the average number of contacts was around 80\% and was quite consistent across all age-classes.

            Background
            Knowing the transmissibility of asymptomatic infections and risk of infection from household- and community-exposures is critical to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 control. Limited previous evidence is based primarily on virologic testing, which disproportionately misses mild and asymptomatic infections. Serologic measures are more likely to capture all previously infected individuals.
          
          
            Objective
            Estimate the risk of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection from household and community exposures, and identify key risk factors for transmission and infection.
          
          
            Design
            Cross-sectional household serosurvey and transmission model.
          
          
            Setting
            Geneva, Switzerland
          
          
            Participants
            4,524 household members ≥5 years from 2,267 households enrolled April-June 2020.
          
          
            Measurements
            Past {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection confirmed through {IgG} {ELISA}. Chain-binomial models based on the number of infections within households used to estimate the cumulative extra-household infection risk and infection risk from exposure to an infected household member by demographics and infector’s symptoms.
          
          
            Results
            The chance of being infected by a {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infected household member was 17.3\% (95\%{CrI},13.7-21.7\%) compared to a cumulative extra-household infection risk of 5.1\% (95\%{CrI},4.5-5.8\%). Infection risk from an infected household member increased with age, with 5-9 year olds having 0.4 times (95\%{CrI}, 0.07-1.4) the odds of infection, and ≥65 years olds having 2.7 (95\%{CrI},0.88-7.4) times the odds of infection of 20-49 year olds. Working-age adults had the highest extra-household infection risk. Seropositive asymptomatic household members had 69.6\% lower odds (95\%{CrI},33.7-88.1\%) of infecting another household member compared to those reporting symptoms, accounting for 14.7\% (95\%{CrI},6.3-23.2\%) of all household infections.
          
          
            Limitations
            Self-reported symptoms, small number of seropositive kids and imperfect serologic tests.
          
          
            Conclusion
            The risk of infection from exposure to a single infected household member was more than three-times that of extra-household exposures over the first pandemic wave. Young children had a lower risk of infection from household members. Asymptomatic infections are far less likely to transmit than symptomatic ones but do cause infections.

	abstract = {The large number of individuals placed into quarantine because of possible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS} {CoV}-2) exposure has high societal and economic costs. There is ongoing debate about the appropriate duration of quarantine, particularly since the fraction of individuals who eventually test positive is perceived as being low. We use empirically determined distributions of incubation period, infectivity, and generation time to quantify how the duration of quarantine affects onward transmission from traced contacts of confirmed {SARS}-{CoV}-2 cases and from returning travellers. We also consider the roles of testing followed by release if negative (test-and-release), reinforced hygiene, adherence, and symptoms in calculating quarantine efficacy. We show that there are quarantine strategies based on a test-and-release protocol that, from an epidemiological viewpoint, perform almost as well as a 10-day quarantine, but with fewer person-days spent in quarantine. The findings apply to both travellers and contacts, but the specifics depend on the context.
          , 
            The {COVID}-19 pandemic has led many countries to impose quarantines, ensuring that people who may have been exposed to the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus or who return from abroad are isolated for a specific period to prevent the spread of the disease. These measures have crippled travel, taken a large economic toll, and affected the wellbeing of those needing to self-isolate. However, there is no consensus on how long {COVID}-19 quarantines should be.
            Reducing the duration of quarantines could significantly decrease the costs of {COVID}-19 to the overall economy and to individuals, so Ashcroft et al. decided to examine how shorter isolation periods and test-and-release schemes affected transmission. Existing data on how {SARS}-{CoV}-2 behaves in a population were used to generate a model that would predict how changing quarantine length impacts transmission for both travellers and people who may have been exposed to the virus. The analysis predicted that shortening quarantines from ten to seven days would result in almost no increased risk of transmission, if paired with {PCR} testing on day five of isolation (with people testing positive being confined for longer). The quarantine could be cut further to six days if rapid antigen tests were used.
            Ashcroft et al.’s findings suggest that it may be possible to shorten {COVID}-19 quarantines if good testing approaches are implemented, leading to better economic, social and individual outcomes.},

          Throughout the past six months, no number has dominated the public media more persistently than the reproduction number of {COVID}-19. This powerful but simple concept is widely used by the public media, scientists, and political decision makers to explain and justify political strategies to control the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Here we explore the effectiveness of political interventions using the reproduction number of {COVID}-19 across Europe. We propose a dynamic {SEIR} epidemiology model with a time-varying reproduction number, which we identify using machine learning. During the early outbreak, the basic reproduction number was 4.22±1.69, with maximum values of 6.33 and 5.88 in Germany and the Netherlands. By May 10, 2020, it dropped to 0.67±0.18, with minimum values of 0.37 and 0.28 in Hungary and Slovakia. We found a strong correlation between passenger air travel, driving, walking, and transit mobility and the effective reproduction number with a time delay of 17.24±2.00 days. Our new dynamic {SEIR} model provides the flexibility to simulate various outbreak control and exit strategies to inform political decision making and identify safe solutions in the benefit of global health.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Historically, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases have caused large, deadly, and expensive multi-national outbreaks. Often outbreak investigations aim to identify who infected whom by reconstructing the outbreak transmission tree, which visualizes transmission between individuals as a network with nodes representing individuals and branches representing transmission from person to person. We compiled a database of 383 published, standardized transmission trees consisting of 16 directly-transmitted diseases ranging in size from 2 to 286 cases. For each tree and disease we calculated several key statistics, such as outbreak size, average number of secondary infections, the dispersion parameter, and the number of superspreaders. We demonstrated the potential utility of the database through short analyses addressing questions about superspreader epidemiology for a variety of diseases, including {COVID}-19. First, we compared the frequency and contribution of superspreaders to onward transmission across diseases. {COVID}-19 outbreaks had significantly fewer superspreaders than outbreaks of {SARS} and {MERS} and a dispersion parameter between that of {SARS} and {MERS}. Across diseases the presence of more superspreaders was associated with greater outbreak size. Second, we further examined how early spread impacts tree size. Generally, trees sparked by a superspreader had larger outbreak sizes than those trees not sparked by a superspreader, and this trend was significant for {COVID}-19 trees. Third, we investigated patterns in how superspreaders are infected. Across trees with more than one superspreader, we found support for the theory that superspreaders generate other superspreaders, even when controlling for number of secondary infections. In sum, our findings put the role of superspreading to {COVID}-19 transmission in perspective with that of {SARS} and {MERS} and suggest an avenue for further research on the generation of superspreaders. These data have been made openly available to encourage reuse and further scientific inquiry.
          
            Author Summary
            Public health investigations often aim to identify who infected whom, or the transmission tree, during outbreaks of infectious diseases. These investigations tend to be resource intensive but valuable as they contain epidemiological information, including the average number of infections caused by each individual and the variation in this number. To date, there remains no standardized format nor comprehensive database of infectious disease transmission trees. To fill this gap, we standardized and compiled more than 350 published transmission trees for 16 directly-transmitted diseases into a database that is publicly available. In this paper, we give an overview of the database construction process, as well as a demonstration of the types of questions that the database can be used to answer related to superspreader epidemiology. For example, we show that {COVID}-19 outbreaks have fewer superspreaders than outbreaks of {SARS} and {MERS}. We also find support for the theory that superspreaders generate other superspreaders. In the future, this database can be used to answer other outstanding questions in the field of epidemiology.},

            Our understanding of the evolution of the {COVID}-19 pandemic is built upon data concerning confirmed cases and deaths. This data, however, can only be meaningfully interpreted alongside an accurate understanding of the extent of virus testing in different countries. This new database brings together official data on the extent of {PCR} testing over time for 94 countries. We provide a time series for the daily number of tests performed, or people tested, together with metadata describing data quality and comparability issues needed for the interpretation of the time series. The database is updated regularly through a combination of automated scraping and manual collection and verification, and is entirely replicable, with sources provided for each observation. In providing accessible cross-country data on testing output, it aims to facilitate the incorporation of this crucial information into epidemiological studies, as well as track a key component of countries’ responses to {COVID}-19.},

                        levels of infection. Genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between
                        November 2020 and January 2021 revealed the emergence and circulation of a
                        novel {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variant of concern. Lineage P.1 acquired 17 mutations,
                        including a trio in the spike protein (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) associated
                        with increased binding to the human {ACE}2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)
                        receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around
                        mid-November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular
                        evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and
                        mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.7- to 2.4-fold more

	abstract = {Abstract
          As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) pandemic expands, genomic epidemiology and whole genome sequencing are being constantly used to investigate its transmissions and evolution. In the backdrop of the global emergence of “variants of concern” ({VOCs}) during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part of India since January 2021, whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches was undertaken to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of current circulating strains.
          Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the predominant clade in circulation was a distinct newly identified lineage B.1.617 possessing common signature mutations D111D, G142D, L452R, E484Q, D614G and P681R, in the spike protein including within the receptor binding domain ({RBD}). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 484 and 681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The structural analysis of {RBD} mutations L452R and E484Q along with P681R in the furin cleavage site, revealed that these may possibly result in increased {ACE}2 binding and rate of S1-S2 cleavage resulting in better transmissibility. The same two {RBD} mutations indicated decreased binding to select monoclonal antibodies ({mAbs}) and may affect their neutralization potential. Experimental validation against a wider panel of {mAbs}, sera from vaccinees and those that recovered from natural infection needs to be studied.
          The emergence of such local variants through the accumulation of convergent mutations during the {COVID}-19 second wave needs to be further investigated for their public health impact in the rest of the country and its possibility of becoming a {VOC}.},

          Pathogen genomes provide insights into their evolution and epidemic spread. We sequenced 1,439 {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genomes from Switzerland, representing 3-7\% of all confirmed cases per week. Using these data, we demonstrate that no one lineage became dominant, pointing against evolution towards general lower virulence. On an epidemiological level, we report no evidence of cryptic transmission before the first confirmed case. We find many early viral introductions from Germany, France, and Italy and many recent introductions from Germany and France. Over the summer, we quantify the number of non-traceable infections stemming from introductions, quantify the effective reproductive number, and estimate the degree of undersampling. Our framework can be applied to quantify evolution and epidemiology in other locations or for other pathogens based on genomic data.
